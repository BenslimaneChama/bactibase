![LOGO](/BenslimaneChama/bactibase/www/bactibase_logo.png)

Welcome to **Bactibase**, a user-friendly web application designed to introduce and explore information on five highly represented bacterias in Morocco. The app provides visual representations, including pictures, a family tree, and detailed information on various aspects of these bacteria, such as their **genomic characteristics** and **antibiotic resistance**.

# Introduction 

Bactibase is a tool that aims to make learning about bacteria more engaging through interactive elements. Whether you are a student, a researcher, or just curious about microbiology, Bactibase offers a simplified approach to exploring bacterial data.


# Features

**Pictures:** Visual representation of each bacterium.
**Family Tree:** A family tree showing the relationships between the five bacteria.
**Information Section:** Detailed descriptions where users can choose to view genomic information and other types.


# How to Use

**Access the App:** You can access the Bactibase web app through this link: [Bactibase Web App](https://bactibase.shinyapps.io/bactibase/).
**Explore the Bacteria:**
**Pictures:** Click on the images of the bacteria to see a larger view.
**Family Tree:** Navigate through the family tree to understand the relationships between the bacteria.
**Information Section:** Use the drop-down menus or buttons provided to select the type of information you want to view, such as genomic data, characteristics, or other relevant details such as antibiotic resistance and pathogenicity.
**Navigate Between Sections:** The app is designed to be intuitive, allowing you to easily move between different sections by clicking on the provided tabs or links. As the main developer of the app, I look forward to adding more bacteria data in another perspective such as agronomic perspective traiting symbiotic parameters.


# Bacteria Information

The app includes five bacteria, each with a detailed profile. The profiles cover:
**Taxonomy:** Classification and naming.
**Genomic Information:** Data on the genome of each bacterium.
**Morphology:** Structural details shown in a carousel of different images(microscopic,petri dish colony formation, etc …)
**Pathogenicity:** Information on how these bacteria cause disease.
**Mechanism of Resistance to antibiotic’s treatment:** Their mechanisme of diffence against antibiotic effects.
